# [My Knowledge Wiki üåø](https://wiki.nikiv.dev)

This is my personal wiki where I share  about this world in form of an online wiki built with [Docusaurus](tools/docusaurus.md) on GitHub.

## Getting started

This garden is quite literally my digital brain. It includes my thoughts, notes and links on topics I care about.


The content uses markdown files, which after every commit to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jourlez/knowledge) builds the website using [Docusaurus](tools/docusaurus.md) and publishes it.

The way I structure each page often looks the same and follows a structure. The sidebar you see on the left is sorted alphabetically. It's nested too. Many top level folders are nested quite deep.

What I would suggest if this is the first time you came across this wiki and genuinely want to learn something new is to scroll the sidebar on the left or search for something, more likely then not, I wrote something about it.

## Content Structure

As mentioned, I like to keep a sort of structure for pages. It's roughly:

1. Title with optional description to describe topic.
2. My thoughts on the topic.
3. Subtopics - Various subtopics related to the main topic.
4. Notes - Notes on the topic as well as things I found interesting on the internet regarding the topic. I often give a link of where I got things from.
5. Code - Code snippets.
6. Links - Links related to the topic.

## Helping improve the wiki

If you find some mistake, especially if something that I say is plain wrong, please fork [this repository](https://github.com/jourlez/knowledge) and make a PR with correct changes. Or [open an issue](https://github.com/jourlez/knowledge/issues/new) saying what you think is wrong, asking questions or making suggestions. Any feedback if it's constructive is welcome. So as any suggestion to improve the content. There is also GitHub [file search](https://github.com/jourlez/knowledge/find/main) & [content search](https://github.com/jourlez/knowledge/search?q=docusaurus&unscoped_q=docusaurus) available that's quite neat.

## Grow your own digital garden üå±

As I mentioned, these wikis are also called digital gardens. There is a [DigitalGardens community on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/) which discusses tools to maintain & create these wikis. As well as how to use them to develop [new transformative tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/).

I enjoy meeting new people so feel free to reach out. I also hope you share what you know with the world as a form of a wiki like this too. It truly had a life changing effect on my life.
